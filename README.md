# Predictive Modeling of Chronic Health Conditions

**Abstract:**  
This project uses clinical and lifestyle variables to build multi-class classifiers (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) for predicting chronic conditions (Diabetes, Hypertension, Asthma, etc.). The repository contains the project report (`Predictive_Modeling_Report.pdf`) and the R analysis script (`scripts/analysis.R`). Results indicate XGBoost provided the best balance of accuracy and recall after feature engineering and handling class imbalance.

## Files
- `Predictive_Modeling_Report.pdf` — Final project report
- `scripts/analysis.R` — R script used for preprocessing, feature engineering, modelling and evaluation
- `data/` — (optional) data files — **do not include sensitive/raw patient data**

## How to reproduce
1. Open `scripts/analysis.R` in RStudio.  
2. Install required packages (see script header).  
3. Run the script step-by-step.
